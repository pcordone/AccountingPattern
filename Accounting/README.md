# Accounting

## Description


## Installation

You need to have gyb installed in order to code generate the enum CurrencyType from the command line.  I used brew to install gyb:
    
    brew install nshipster/formulae/gyb

To generate CurrencyType with gyb at terminal in the Accounting project type:
    
    make

To delete the generated files type:
    
    make clean
